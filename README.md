# Try it at home !

You only need to have the docker daemon and docker compose.

Simply run `docker compose up -d --build` to run the project. It'll build the app and try to connect to the database (which should fail, unless you use your own database).

Or visit https://client-production-cd5e.up.railway.app/ to test it out !
